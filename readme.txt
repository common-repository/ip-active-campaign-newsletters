== Frequently Asked Questions ==

-where do I find the numeric ids of my ActiveCampaign Lists?  Answer: Visit your ActiveCampaign Admin, Contacts > Lists and hover over or click on any List to see its listid in the url

-Why is my mailing not scheduling?  Answer: If your account is new, ActiveCampaign requires you to create and send a minimum of 10 Campaigns before one can be scheduled via api.  After doing so, the system can make several days to recognize this.  Commons reasons for this issue in accounts not meeting the former case include derelict payment, spam complaints and going over the contractual Contacts limit.
